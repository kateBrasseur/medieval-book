# Signing up for Non-University Accounts

In this class, we'll be working with various digital platforms that will allow us to do tackle different parts of working with a digital archive. Our goal in using different platforms is not to make a perfect digital copy (Latin: per "thoroughly" +factus "made/ complete"), but to see how digitization work can look differently depending on expectations and uses.

One of our first steps is establishing an online public profile. This process will require that all students sign up for a number of different accounts (see below) in order to begin to establish a professional and an academic presence. We will set up a profile, first on hcommons.org, using your real name. BUT, if you have a reason to not want to use your real name, please let me know and together we can sort out another option.

# Slack

To help with communication in this class, I want to try to avoid email or culearn, but instead will try to centralize communication through Slack. Slack is a group messanger application, that can be installed on your phone and tablet, used on your browser or a desktop app.

1. Download desktop apps [here](https://slack.com/downloads/) and other versions depending on the OS of your mobile device.
2. Sign in to our slack group – following the link I will send out after our first class.
3. Click on "Channels" in the sidebar (on desktop or browser versions). It should say "Browse all channels" if you hover your cursor over it. Add yourself to all public channels you can. 

# Humanities Commons

Humanities Commons will be a hub for much of our initial activity, your profiles acting as a repository for much of the information about each student as well as the place where students will be blogging about their work and ideas. 

1. Visit [here](https://registry.hcommons.org/registry/co_petitions/start/coef:158) to sign up for a Humanities Commons profile.
2. After you have successfully registered and  added content to your profile page (pretty pictures, description of yourself, your academic interests), search for the group "Medieval Book @ Carleton" (or go to the group's [url](https://hcommons.org/groups/medieval-book-carleton/)) and click on the button in the header, "Join group".
3. Post a link to your profile on Slack in the channel #profile.
4. Check with me to make sure I add your profile to the [Medieval Book](https://medievalbook.hcommons.org) blog.

# ORCID

As it notes on their website, "ORCID provides a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher and, through integration in key research workflows such as manuscript and grant submission, supports automated linkages between you and your professional activities ensuring that your work is recognized." This means you create an indentity which allows your work to be identified as yours (including work completed in this course).

1. Register for an account [here](https://orcid.org). Add your level of education and, if you have published something, try to add it to your "Works". Click on "Add Works" button, and click either "search and link" using CrossRef Search or "Add manually".
2. Add your ORCID identifier to your hcommons profile.

# Twitter

We want to get you on the Twitter to encourage you to get familiar with what digital medievalists are talking about, what they are reading and what they are writing about. Twitter operates like medieval *fama* – an echo chamber of speech flitting about spreading rumours. With the immediacy of digital pseudo-presence,  Twitter collapses distance and difference. It is rarely obvious who is a senior scholar and who is a student, who is simply an interested on-looker and who is a hyper-specialist. Our goal in engaging with Twitter is for each of you to use it as a way to do some superficial research, network with other likeminded scholars and put yourself (and your work) out there....

1. Sign up for Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup). If you are already on Twitter you may wish to create a new account for the class.
2. Make sure to add your Twitter handle to your hcommons profile and, once you've joined our [slack group](https://digitalarchiving.slack.com), add your twitter to the channel, #twitter.
3. Navigate to the professor's Twitter [profile](https://twitter.com/savrett) and subscribe to the Twitter list [*DigitizingMedievalMss*](https://twitter.com/savrett/lists). A Twitter list is simply a list of interesting people and institutions working in the fields manuscript studies and the digital humanities. If you find people you think are interested, follow them directly so that you get ongoing updates from their Twitter feed (a twitter list only updates when you click on it).
4. Add your twitter feed to the slack channel #twitter. Navigate to the channel and then click "Add an App". On the right sidebar, you should see a twitter icon with the drop down button named "Settings". Click on that to configure the app so that you can post from your twitter feed to the Slack.
5. Add the hashtag #Hist4006 to your class tweets. Actually, let's only use this hashtag if we don't come up with something more catchy in class.

# Omeka

The class will be working together on a Omeka site [here](https://medievalottawa.org). Once you navigate to this site, on the top right hand corner, thre will be the option to "Register". Click on the link and fill out the form. The Omeka user names are private so please use the name by wcich I will know you. You will be sent an email with a link to confirm your email (it will take a few minutes to arrive so be patient). After you click you will be registered as a guest user, which I will update to "researcher" (which gives you more access) as soon I have a chance.
